# Final-Project
For this final presentation of the Taranis Bikes homepage, you will find features such as a video, pictures, and and a content hierarchy that helps the user find the product, but also gives the user assurance through expert support while providing authenticity. This project just represents the final version of my UI/UX Design course project. All designs were made in Figma.
